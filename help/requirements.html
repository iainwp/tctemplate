		<h2>Requirements</h2>
	</header>
	<main id="mainView">
		<ul>
			<li>TCTemplate works on any device with most modern web browsers, including most phones and desktop computers, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android. <b>However, Microsoft Edge does not work</b> - it should do once it migrates to Chromium later in 2019.</li>
			<li>To prepare the maps in Purple Pen, Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or newer is required. For other operating systems, use a virtual Windows 10 installation for free - see the <a href="http://purplepen.golde.org/virtualbox.htm" target="prequisites">Purple Pen website</a> for details.</li>
			<li>You will need a printer capable of a 10 mm margin on all 4 sides for A4 paper.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Data Usage</h3>
		<p>The initial webpage is 61 KB, but generating the PDFs will use 9.3 MB. However, your browser should cache all of these files, so should not need to download them again unless you close the webpage. Your map files are not uploaded to the server, so the quality of your maps does not affect data usage.</p>
