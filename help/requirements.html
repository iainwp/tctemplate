		<ul>
			<li>TCTemplate works on any device with most modern web browsers, including most phones and desktop computers, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android. However, Microsoft Edge (on Windows) often fails to display part of the wizard, but it will be migrated to Chromium at some point, so is not supported until then.</li>
			<li>To prepare the maps in Purple Pen, Microsoft Windows XP or newer is required, although it should work in a virtual Windows machine on Mac or Linux (it does not work under Wine on Mac).</li>
			<li>You will need a printer capable of a 10 mm margin on all 4 sides for A4 paper.</li>
