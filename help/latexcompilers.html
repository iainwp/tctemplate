		<p>The PDFs of the map cards are generated using LaTeX. It is recommended that you compile it in the browser using the <em>Generate map cards</em> button, but sometimes you may encounter technical problems, or just prefer to use your own LaTeX compiler anyway. Two methods of compiling are:</p>
		<h3>Online Using Overleaf</h3>
		<p>This is the simplest option for getting started, if you are unfamiliar with LaTeX.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Download <a href="../TCTemplate.tex" download="TCTemplate.tex">TCTemplate.tex</a> to an empty folder.</li>
			<li>Click on the <em>Save station data</em> button and save the produced file (TemplateParameters.tex) to the same folder.</li>
			<li>Copy the maps PDF file to the folder and rename it to <code>Maps.pdf</code> (case sensitive).</li>
			<li>Copy the control descriptions PDF file to the folder and rename it to <code>CDs.pdf</code> (case sensitive).</li>
			<li>Compress the four files into a Zip archive.
				<ul>
					<li>Windows: Select all the files, right click, then click <em>Send to->Compressed (zipped) folder</em>.</li>
					<li>MacOS: Go up one level, right click on the folder, then click <em>Compress</em>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Create a free <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="Overleaf">Overleaf</a> account and log in.</li>
			<li>Click on the upload button next to <em>New Project</em> in the top left of the screen, then choose <em>Upload Zip</em>.</li>
			<li>Upload the Zip archive you just created.</li>
			<li>Click on <em>PDF</em> on the top row of the screen to create and download the produced map cards, ready for printing.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Other LaTeX Compilers</h3>
		<p>Although Overleaf works well, compiling locally on your computer is faster, so is recommended if you're helping to develop TCTemplate. The Javascript version in the browser uses <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/" target="TeXLive">TeX Live</a> (ported using Emscripten), so you could try that - it works on all major operating systems. Follow steps 1-4 above, then compile <code>TCTemplate.tex</code>.</p>
		<h3>Known Issues</h3>
		<p>The <em>Generate map cards</em> button should work in all major browsers, but there are some known issues, as follows. If you discover any that are not on this list, please <a href="https://github.com/tdobra/tctemplate/issues" target="repo">log an issue</a> or contact the author, stating which browser and operating system you are using, along with any other useful information.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Safari fails to read certain PDF files. The cause is unknown. Please <a href="https://github.com/tdobra/tctemplate/issues" target="repo">log an issue</a> with any filenames or special features of files that cause trouble.</li>
			<li>Microsoft Edge is unsupported until it is updated to Chromium.</li>
