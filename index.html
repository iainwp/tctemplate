				<li>Set up an event in <a href="http://purplepen.golde.org" target="PurplePen">Purple Pen</a>, ensuring the print scale is set correctly. Keep the event title short, so that it fits on one line in the control descriptions (it will not be shown in the finished product anyway).</li>
        <li>Go to Event->Customize Appearance. Untick <em>Use IOF standard sizes</em>. Set the control circle diameter to 6 mm (current recommended size). Click OK.</li>
				<li>Mark each question control to be used, cut the circles as required and set the control description. The content of columns A and B does not matter, nor do the control codes.</li>
				<li>Create a course for each problem. Name it in the format <em>name of station.i</em>, where <em>i</em> is the problem number counting from 1. It is not recommended to include the word <em>station</em> in the name, and it is simplest to be just a number, although it could be <em>warm-up</em>. For example, the 3<sup>rd</sup> problem at the 2<sup>nd</sup> could be be named <em>3.2</em>. Set the course type to score. The stations will be printed in the order of the 1<sup>st</sup> map at each station.</li>
				<li>Add the (single) control to the course. It doesn't matter whether a start and finished are also added, so long as they are outside the map excerpts.</li>
				<li>Move the purple number labelling the control to near the start triangle, so that it is out of the field of view. (At the time of writing, Purple Pen does not permit this label to be removed, which would be preferable here.)</li>
				<li>Set the print area for all courses (under the File menu) to have 0 margin, limit the printable area to the page size and define the printable area manually. Select a paper size (custom size if necessary) that is large enough to include all parts of the map that are to be printed. Move the print area to cover all desired parts of the map and click done. (This timed control map generator software does not require each course/map to have the same print area, although the author considers it easier for the user to do so.)</li>
				<li>Create a single PDF of all the courses using File->Create PDFs and choosing to have one copy of each course all in a single PDF. Select all courses, including those not intended to be printed, but not the all controls map. Upload the maps PDF: <input type="file" id="coursePDFSelector" accept=".pdf" /></li>
				<li>Create a single PDF of all the control descriptions using File->Print control descriptions. Choose fill one page with multiple copies of each course. Select all courses, including those not intended to be printed, but not the all controls. Choose a PDF printer with A4 page size. Set the box size to 7 mm. Leave the page margins at the default of 12.7 mm on all sides (appears as 13 mm in the main dialog). Upload the descriptions PDF: <input type="file" id="CDPDFSelector" accept=".pdf" /></li>
				<li>Save the Purple Pen file, then upload it to this wizard: <input type="file" id="ppenSelector" accept=".ppen" onchange="loadppen(this)" /><input type="button" value="Reload" onclick="loadppen(document.getElementById('ppenSelector'))" /></li>

				<li>Fill in the details of each station in the table:
					<ul>
						<li>Use the first row to overwrite the values for all stations. The values will update automatically.</li>
						<li>Untick the box in the show column to exclude the station from the printed output.</li>
						<li>The station name is read-only; to change it, rename the courses in Purple Pen, then reload the file.</li>
						<li>The number of kites must be less than or equal to 6, and should be 5 or 6 (rule 16.10, <a href="http://orienteering.org/trail-orienteering/rules/" target="rules">IOF Trail Orienteering Competition Rules 2018</a>).</li>
						<li>Tick the zeroes box if zero (no kite correct) is a permitted answer. This should be ticked for TempO and unticked for PreO.</li>
						<li>Heading is the bearing in degrees of the line subtending the left-most and right-most kite from the observation point.</li>
						<li>The printed map can either be circular or square (IOF rule 15.7).</li>
						<li>The circle diameter or square side length should be between 5 and 12 cm (IOF rule 15.7). Do not include the unit in the textbox.</li>
						<li>The map scale is read automatically from the Purple Pen file. It may be changed here if the OCAD map file was set up incorrectly, although it will not change the print scale of the map excerpts. It should be 1:4000 or 1:5000 and be constant across all maps in a competition (IOF rule 15.2).</li>
						<li>The contour interval must be stated in metres, without typing the unit in the text box.</li>
